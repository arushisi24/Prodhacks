This Chrome extension assists students as they work through the FAFSA website by providing  on-screen guidance and (where supported) autofill hints based on information collected in the FAFSA Buddy chatbot.

Start here: Use the FAFSA Buddy chatbot first
Before opening the extension, please enter your information in the chatbot so the extension has the context it needs to help with autofill and guidance.
